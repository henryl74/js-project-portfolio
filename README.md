# Portfolio Project 2 - Studio Ghibli Memory Game


The classic memory game is a common children's game played with a set of cards. The cards have a picture on one side and each picture appears on two cards. The game starts with all the cards face down and the players take turns to turn over two cards. If the two cards have the same picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards face down again. The winner is the person with the most cards when all the cards have been taken.

In this web version the rules are practically the same, however only one person can play at the time; and the palyer doesn't get to keep the cards :)

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge acquired throughout the course in HTML, CSS, and primerely focusing on JavaScript.

### - Sixteen Cards for the Game

- The cards have been distributed in a nice grid of 4 cards by column by 4 by row.
- Each card has been nicely styled, I implemented a small animation when is hovered with the mouse.
- Each card changes to different matching colours when clicked, this feature makes the game more enjoyable, nice to first view and interactive.
- The game results are clear to the user, for each card matched the card will freeze and stay up displaying the image of the film, making the game easy to play.

## Features Left to Implement

- Due to time constraints I could not implement a timer, and two different levels of difficulty; these features will be taken into consideration for the future.
