# Portfolio Project 2 - Studio Ghibli Memory Game


The classic memory game is a common children's game played with a set of cards. The cards have a picture on one side and each picture appears on two cards. The game starts with all the cards face down and the players take turns to turn over two cards. If the two cards have the same picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards face down again. The winner is the person with the most cards when all the cards have been taken.

In this web version the rules are practically the same, however only one person can play at the time; and the palyer doesn't get to keep the cards :)

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge acquired throughout the course in HTML, CSS, and primerely focusing on JavaScript.
